## Introduction to the React Native Challenges

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications that can run outside of the browser — most commonly iOS and Android applications

It can be used to build applications on Windows devices, desktop OS’s, and Apple TV apps as well but this guide will only be covering it’s most common purpose — Android and iOS applications.

**What is React Native?**

React Native falls in-between native and hybrid applications on the mobile app spectrum. The user interface you create is entirely native and the overall application performance is nearly as good as writing a native app. It also gives you the flexibility to embed web views (webpages) or native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Objective C/Swift for iOS) inside your applications wherever you want.

It follows the same pattern as React where the views (what you see on the screen) are rendered from the JavaScript files. The difference is that it supplies its own API for handling native mobile views vs the DOM on the web. If you are confused about how this works, follow this guide on freeCodeCamp and it will take you step by step through these concepts.
